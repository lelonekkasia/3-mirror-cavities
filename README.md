3 mirr cavity dynamics - first try without classes

3 mirror cavity stability - stability curves

3 mirror cavity is basically equivalent to 3 mirror cavity dynamics with some more exploration of the peak structure


3MC.txt is how Paul Stevens did it for reference

copying paul is a cross check (not fully correct, updated in later files)
n mirror cavity ULTIMATE VERSION is what i was mostly using i think

optimizing params 3 mirror cavity is an exploration of the spectrum with parameter variation 

report plots possibly most useful file


i keep all version of classes in case someone wants to see the mistakes i made before
